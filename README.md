# PDFfetcher
A web scraping tool to fetch PDF files within a website

A typical use cass:
- **I**: User passes an URI to this script (eg: http://example-site.com)
- **O**: User recives all the possible PDF links from the site. *simple as that*

*Note*: Early stages of work, if you like to collaborate - please feel free to fork the app and send me a pull request.

**Footnote:* I - *Input*; O - *Output*;
